# FAQ

### Can I use this for circular progress indicators?
No, but there are other packages available for that! 

### Can I set the length or depth of each segment?
No, all segments will be equal.

### Can I customize this myself?
Your best bet is to copy the code into a new component, then hack away from there. Good luck!
